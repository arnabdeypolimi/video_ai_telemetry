# ModalTrace vs. Alternatives

<img src="logo.svg" alt="ModalTrace" width="240" />

Choosing the right observability tool for your AI video pipeline.

ModalTrace is the **only** open-source observability library purpose-built for real-time video AI workloads. While general-purpose tools excel in their domains, none offer native frame-level metrics, A/V sync tracking, or pipeline-stage tracing designed for video inference pipelines.

## Per-Platform Comparison

### Langfuse

**Best for:** LLM application observability, prompt management, evaluation pipelines.

Langfuse is the go-to open-source platform for LLM tracing — it tracks prompt versions, token usage, and model costs out of the box. However, it has no concept of video frames, GPU hardware metrics, or A/V synchronization. If your pipeline combines LLM inference with video processing, you can run ModalTrace alongside Langfuse and export both to a shared OTLP backend.

### Pydantic Logfire

**Best for:** Python-first teams wanting great DX for general application monitoring.

Logfire offers a beautiful developer experience with live span visualization and tight Pydantic integration. It supports OpenTelemetry natively and handles structured logging well. It lacks video-specific semantics (frame rates, encode/render stages, drift tracking) and is SaaS-only with no self-hosted option.

### Datadog APM

**Best for:** Enterprise teams needing full-stack observability with GPU infrastructure monitoring.

Datadog provides GPU metrics via its NVML integration and has broad APM capabilities. However, it has no video AI semantic conventions — you'd need to build custom dashboards and metrics for frame-level observability. Pricing starts at $31/host/month and scales quickly. ModalTrace can export OTLP data to Datadog if you need both.

### Jaeger

**Best for:** Distributed tracing in microservice architectures.

Jaeger is a mature, free, CNCF-graduated tracing backend. It excels at trace visualization and service dependency mapping. It handles traces only — no metrics, no logs, no GPU monitoring. ModalTrace can export traces to Jaeger while providing the metrics and video-specific instrumentation that Jaeger lacks.

### Weights & Biases (W&B)

**Best for:** ML experiment tracking, hyperparameter sweeps, and batch training monitoring.

W&B provides GPU monitoring and media logging (images, video, audio) for experiment tracking. It's batch-oriented — designed for training runs, not real-time inference pipelines. W&B doesn't support OpenTelemetry or real-time frame-level metrics. Use W&B for training, ModalTrace for production inference.

### MLflow

**Best for:** ML lifecycle management, model registry, and experiment tracking.

MLflow added full OpenTelemetry support in v3.6, making it interoperable with OTel backends. It covers the ML lifecycle well (training, evaluation, deployment) but has no video pipeline concepts. If you use MLflow for model management, ModalTrace complements it for production video inference observability.

### OpenLIT

**Best for:** LLM and GenAI observability with OpenTelemetry-native GPU monitoring.

OpenLIT offers OTel-native GPU metrics and supports multiple LLM providers out of the box. It's focused on GenAI workloads (token tracking, cost analysis, prompt evaluation) rather than video processing. It lacks frame metrics, A/V sync, and video pipeline stage tracing.

## When to Use ModalTrace

ModalTrace is the right choice when you need:

- **Real-time video AI observability** — frame rates, dropped frames, encode/render/inference latency
- **GPU monitoring tied to video pipeline stages** — not just hardware metrics, but per-stage GPU utilization
- **A/V synchronization tracking** — drift detection, chunk mismatch alerts, jitter metrics
- **Lightweight, self-hosted instrumentation** — `pip install modaltrace`, no external services required
- **OpenTelemetry compatibility** — export to any OTLP backend while keeping video-specific semantics

## When to Use Alternatives

Be pragmatic. ModalTrace isn't the right tool for every job:

- **LLM prompt tracing & evaluation** — Use [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) or [OpenLIT](https://openlit.io)
- **Batch ML training & experiment tracking** — Use [W&B](https://wandb.ai) or [MLflow](https://mlflow.org)
- **Enterprise full-stack APM** — Use [Datadog](https://datadoghq.com) or [New Relic](https://newrelic.com)
- **General Python app monitoring** — Use [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev)
- **Pure distributed tracing** — Use [Jaeger](https://jaegertracing.io) directly

## Works Together

ModalTrace exports standard OTLP telemetry, so it complements any observability backend. Common combinations:

| Stack | How it works |
|-------|-------------|
| ModalTrace + Jaeger | ModalTrace instruments video pipeline, exports traces to Jaeger for visualization |
| ModalTrace + Datadog | ModalTrace adds video-specific metrics, Datadog provides infrastructure monitoring |
| ModalTrace + Langfuse | ModalTrace handles video pipeline, Langfuse handles LLM components |
| ModalTrace + Grafana | ModalTrace exports metrics via OTLP, Grafana provides custom dashboards |
